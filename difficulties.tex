\section{Difficulties}

\subsection{Coupling}
Coupling is the cyclic dependency between units to be tested.
\rem{Explain what is coupling, why it is bad, how hard it is to prevent, and common practices e.g. abstraction, interfaces, mocking to prevent coupling}
\rem{Consider cyclic dependency checks in golang, which is an excellent example of why it is hard}

\subsection{Test case selection}
As the number of variables to a feature increases, the number of test cases might increase exponentially.
