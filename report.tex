\section{What is unit testing?}
Unit testing is the practice of testing every small unit of a large project instead of only testing the output.

\section{Motivation}
\subsection{Discover bugs early}
As the scale of a software project grows, debugging becomes more complicated.
It may take a long time to discover edge case bugs in an old component, which is very difficult to debug after a long time.
Unit testing allows identification of bugs as soon as possible with little impact.

\subsection{As a method of specification}
Unit testing can also be used as a means of project requirement specification.

\section{Unit testing methods}
\subsection{Testing for expected result}
The intuitive way is to write a test that tests each function.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=CppStyle]
class SimpleSpec {
public:
	void testFooBar() {
		ASSERT_EQUAL(fooBar(), "qux")
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

The \texttt{ASSERT\_EQUAL} macro function would compare the result of \texttt{fooBar()} with \texttt{"qux"} and trigger an error if they are not equal.

\subsection{Generating test parameters}
\rem{Generate parameters randomly, possibly by reverse calculation}

\subsubsection{Testing for edge cases}
\rem{E.g. test for empty strings, Float.INFINITY, 0, etc.}

\subsection{Test case selection}
As the number of variables to a feature increases, the number of test cases might increase exponentially.

\section{Unit testing techniques}
\subsection{Test coverage}
Test coverage is a criterion to assess the representativeness of the unit tests of a project by counting the number of lines executed in the test.

\rem{Talk about the integration of debuggers and how to interpret coverage}

\subsection{Test-driven development (TDD)}
As a consequence of unit testing, development flow becomes more fluent if each development subtask is based on certain test cases.

\subsection{Behaviour-driven development (BDD)}

\rem{Refer to cucumber}

\subsection{Dependency mocking}
\rem{https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/2016/06/09/styles-of-unit-testing/ provides some insight on why mocking is bad}

\section{Coupling between units}
