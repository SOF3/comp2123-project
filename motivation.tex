\section{Motivation}
\subsection{Discover bugs early}
As a software grows in scale, there would be some "stale" components of the software unmodified for a long time.
New components are built upon these older components, but if the older components are not stable enough,
their bugs would propagate to the new components, creating confusion for new developers.

In addition, if a bug is only discovered a long time after writing the corresponding code,
the developer is very likely to forget about what the code was intended to do.

Unit testing allows identification of bugs as soon as possible with little impact, overall reducing the development cost.

\subsection{As a method of specification}
Unit tests can also be used as a means of project requirement specification.
It is common for programmers and users to misunderstand each other's requirements and waste a lot of time.
Unit tests can provide a technical and strict definition of behaviour.
