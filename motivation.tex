\section{Motivation}
\subsection{Discover bugs early}
As the scale of a software project grows, debugging becomes more complicated.
It may take a long time to discover edge case bugs in an old component, which is very difficult to debug after a long time.
Unit testing allows identification of bugs as soon as possible with little impact.

\subsection{As a method of specification}
Unit testing can also be used as a means of project requirement specification.
