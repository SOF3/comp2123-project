\section{Unit testing techniques}
\subsection{Test coverage}
Test coverage is a criterion to assess the representativeness of the unit tests of a project by counting the number of lines executed in the test.

\rem{Talk about the integration of debuggers and how to interpret coverage (codecov.io)}

\subsection{Test-driven development (TDD)}
As a consequence of unit testing, development flow becomes more fluent if each development subtask is based on certain test cases.

\subsection{Behaviour-driven development (BDD)}

\rem{Refer to cucumber's framework}

\rem{TDD and BDD are a bit different, but if we can't explain the difference, we can merge them together}

\subsection{Dependency mocking}
\rem{https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/2016/06/09/styles-of-unit-testing/ provides some insight on why mocking is bad}
