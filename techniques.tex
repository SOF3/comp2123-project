\section{Unit testing techniques}
\subsection{Test coverage}
Test coverage is a criterion to assess the representativeness of the unit tests of a project by counting the number of lines executed in the test.

\rem{Talk about the integration of debuggers and how to interpret coverage (codecov.io)}

\subsection{Test-driven development (TDD)}
As a consequence of unit testing, development flow becomes more fluent if each development subtask is based on certain test cases.

\rem{TODO: Add flowchart}

\subsection{Behaviour-driven development (BDD)}
While TDD provides a reliable method to test individual function executions,
it cannot precisely and concisely define functions that depend on global/object states.
BDD defines the behaviour of a function using some specific terms:

\paragraph{Scenario}

\paragraph{Given}

\paragraph{When}

\paragraph{Then}
\rem{TODO: fill in the blanks}

This framework also subclassifies a task into multiple components to identify the exact source of error.

\rem{TODO: Insert example code here}

\rem{Refer to cucumber's framework}

\subsection{Dependency mocking}
\rem{https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/2016/06/09/styles-of-unit-testing/ provides some insight on why mocking is bad}
\rem{Consider moving this to the part about coupling}
